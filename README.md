## Project Description

The Register Allocator project is a sophisticated tool designed to optimize the allocation of registers for variables in a computer program. By leveraging graph coloring techniques and implementing Chaitin's Briggs algorithm and Linear Scan, this project aims to minimize register spills to memory and improve overall program performance.

Register allocation plays a crucial role in optimizing the execution of programs by efficiently managing limited hardware registers. When the number of variables in a program exceeds the available registers, the compiler needs to decide which variables should reside in registers at any given point during execution. This decision significantly impacts the performance and efficiency of the program.

This project employs graph coloring algorithms, which model variable dependencies as a graph, where nodes represent variables and edges represent dependencies between them. Graph coloring assigns different colors (representing registers) to nodes (variables) in a way that no adjacent nodes share the same color. By using this approach, the register allocator can minimize the need for spilling variables to memory, reducing costly memory access operations and improving program execution speed.

Chaitin's Briggs algorithm is a well-known graph coloring algorithm that prioritizes register allocation based on the variables' liveness and interference. It efficiently allocates registers by taking into account the live ranges of variables and minimizing conflicts between them. This algorithm provides an effective way to assign registers to variables, ensuring optimal performance.

In addition to Chaitin's Briggs algorithm, this project also implements the Linear Scan algorithm. Linear Scan is a linear-time algorithm that allocates registers by scanning the program's variables in a specific order. It identifies live ranges and assigns registers accordingly, efficiently utilizing available registers.
